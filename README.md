🚀 Football Match Prediction & Performance Analysis using Machine Learning

This project focused on predicting the outcomes of Premier League football matches using machine learning models and analyzing team performance through expected goals (xG) metrics.

🔍 Key Objectives:

Predict match outcomes based on historical performance data.

Analyze team strength via xG scored and conceded.

Compare actual match results with model predictions.

📊 Techniques & Tools Used:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed match-level data; created rolling average stats for performance metrics like goals, shots, and distance.

Feature Engineering: Encoded match venue, opponent, and time-based features; engineered rolling averages for better temporal insights.

Modeling: Implemented a Random Forest Classifier to predict match wins; evaluated with accuracy and precision metrics.

Visualization:

xG scored vs xG conceded scatter plot for team performance clustering.

Bar chart comparing predicted vs actual xG differences for selected matches.

Object-Oriented Design: Designed a class structure representing datasets, teams, matches, and players to enable scalable model extensions.

📁 Results:

Achieved a meaningful precision in predicting match wins.

Insights on team strength helped identify teams with strong offense/defense profiles.

⚽️ A data-driven approach to understanding football dynamics, this project blends sports analytics with machine learning to derive predictive insights from performance trends.
